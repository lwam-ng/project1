            <p>“Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web
                devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can make our designs
                more adaptive to the media that renders them."
                By designing websites that adapt to any device, designers and developers could future-proof
                their work.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Minimalism:The principle of minimalism is “less is more”, while modernism focuses on
                    airy design, as clear-cut and clean-lined as possible.</li>
                <li>Color Palettes:color palettes are quite unassuming – they are simple, yet impactful
                    enough. You will have to be consistent with the color palette once you chose one because
                    it will become part of your brand design.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Navigation:It’s best to keep it simple and responsive so that users can rapidly access
                    any section of the website they are interested in.</li>
                <li>Typography:A branded typeface can create a sense of individualism for the respective
                    website, which is the exact result you should strive for. </li>
